Try to sleep about 8-10 a day in order to be more active and focused in your learning
Learning is important, but you should also try to find some time to work on your own hobbies
For every hour that you work, try to take a 10-15 minutes break to be more active and energetic
Don't work yourself to death. Remember to take some breaks from time to time
Prioritize your work according to how long it would take you to finish it, and when do you need to complete it
While having breaks is important, do not get distracted by things such as YouTube, social media, Netflix, etc...
Don't work late into the night. You're health is more important then your grades
